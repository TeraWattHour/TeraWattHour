excerpt: This is certainly the best Far Cry game in some time, you can really have some fun whilst playing it, but does it really feel as good as the good 'ol Far Cry?

For quite some time, Far Cry games are regarded as one of the most popular of their category,
but since Far Cry 4 they struggle with one thing - Far Cry 3. This game has lifted the bar so high that Ubisoft can't
really replicate the feeling that many had been feeling when playing the mentioned title. The immersion,
storyline or the innovations that those games provided are not comparable to what
Far Cry 6 is creating. Don't understand me wrong - Far Cry 6 is one of the best games ever,
but in my opinion it doesn't bring anything new to the series.
