### My experience

Logitech MX Master 3 is a great mouse but it could have been better. Still, I can't possibly criticize the general
feel of the mouse, it's really really great, nevertheless, to be useful, any office equipment has to work
and this product has some problems with it.

I transitioned to this MX Master 3 from another Logitech mouse, their only
common feature is that they tend not to work. Both of them had a scroll wheel defect which made them completely useles.
After RMA'ing those issues dissapeared although it still bothers me when I see thousands of used Logitech products listed
online with very common defects, this shows how Logi loves its customers.

### Features

MX Master 3 has a lot to offer. When scroll wheel works, it's just great - switching modes is easy and
[Logi Options](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/options) software optimizations are pretty useful too (they crash
sometimes though). I'm not really demanding when it comes to side buttons so the provided two buttons are more than enough
for me. Since I use VS Code most frequently, I can't comment on the horizontal scroll feature aside from that that it feels
nice - I just hadnt't used it. The mouse itself fits perfectly in my palm but people with bigger hands might find its specific
shape uncomfortable to grasp. When it comes to weight, MX Master 3 is on the heavier side weighing almost 150 grammes.

This mouse can connect to up to 3 devices using Bluetooth or Logitech proprietary dongle. I use Bluetooth exclusively to connect
it to my MacBook and the bridge between the two devices is strong and not subject to interference. Since I'm mentally stable,
I didn't even try to play games using it but when using office applications latency is unnoticeable for me.
